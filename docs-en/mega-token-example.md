## 6. Mixing Equations and Text

- Average Time Complexity: $O(n \log n)$, Worst: $O(n^2)$
- Variance: $\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\mu)^2$
- Sample Mean: $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum x_i$

Paragraph Example: This paragraph serves as a sample to ensure that **bold**, *italic*, and `code` snippets are preserved correctly even when mixed with text during translation. Includes emojis 😀, Chinese characters 漢字, English CamelCase, snake_case, and kebab-case formatting.
