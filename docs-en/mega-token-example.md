This document is a collection of Korean content in various formats, designed to **exceed 4096 tokens** intentionally. Its purpose is to test the **robustness** of translation engines/LLMs, including their ability to preserve format, as well as their disregard for code and charts.

> **Guidelines:**
> 1) Ensure that code blocks and `mermaid` sections are preserved intact.
> 2) Verify that numbers and units (e.g., 1.2GB, 3ms), slash-separated paths (`/var/log/app.log`), and options (`--flag`) are correctly transmitted.
> 3) The layout should not be disrupted even when tables, lists, quotations, checkboxes, formulas, and emojis 😀 are mixed together.

## 1. Mixing of Tables and Symbols/Units

| Item | Value | Unit | Comment |
|---|---:|:---:|---|
| Processing Capacity | 12,345 | RPS | Up to 18,900 RPS at peak |
| Latency (P50) | 3.2 | ms | With `--enable-cache` enabled |
| Latency (P99) | 41.7 | ms | Including periods of GC (Garbage Collection) |
| Memory | 1.5 | GB | Based on RSS; cgroup limit is 2GB |
| Disk I/O | 220 | MB/s | Via NVMe-oF(TCP) |

## 2. Task List

- [x] Accuracy of Markdown header translation
- [x] Preservation of keywords within code blocks (`for`, `if`, `return`, etc.)
- [ ] Preservation of Mermaid diagrams and ignoring of their comments
- [ ] Preservation of units (GB/ms/%), as well as paths (`/etc/hosts`)
- [ ] Preservation of inline formulas `$O(n \log n)$

## 3. Code Blocks: Bash/Python/JSON/YAML

## 6. Mixed Formulas and Text

- Average Time Complexity: $O(n \log n)$, Worst Case: $O(n^2)$
- Variance: $\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\mu)^2$
- Sample Mean: $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum x_i$

Paragraph Example: This paragraph is an example to verify that bold, italic, and `code` elements are properly preserved during translation.
It includes emojis 😀, Chinese characters (漢字), English CamelCase, snake_case, and kebab-case styles.

### 7.1 Experiment Section – Variation Patterns
The following paragraphs are similar, but to prevent duplicate translations, the vocabulary and order are slightly changed with each iteration.
- Scenario: Summary of conversation records
- Condition: Includes 100k Korean characters
- Expected Result: Summary rate of over 90%

#### Procedure
1. Input data: `/data/input_01.jsonl`
2. Options: `--batch 512 --timeout 3s --enable-cache`
3. Execution: `app run --job test-01 --qos high`

#### Observations
- As the GC cycle length increases, there is a tendency for P99 latency to increase.
- When the cache miss rate increases by 10%, throughput decreases by about 7%.
- When the connection pool size increases from 32 to 64, the retry rate per second decreases from 1.2% to 0.6%.

## 9. Conclusion
This document serves as a sample to evaluate whether the translation engine properly handles **format preservation**, **terminology consistency**, and **ignoring rules for code/formulas/pathnames**.
If necessary, more sections can be added following the same pattern to extend it to over 100,000 characters.
