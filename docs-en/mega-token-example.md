# This document is a collection of Korean content in various formats, designed to exceed 4096 tokens.
It serves as a test for the robustness of translation engines/LLMs, including their ability to handle context, preserve format, and ignore code/table formats.

> **Guidelines:**
> 1) Ensure that code blocks and `mermaid` diagrams are preserved intact.
> 2) Verify that numbers and units (e.g., 1.2GB, 3ms), slash-separated paths (`/var/log/app.log`), and options (`--flag`) are correctly transmitted.
> 3) The layout should not be disrupted even if tables, lists, quotations, checkboxes, formulas, and emojis üòÄ are mixed together.


## 1. Mixing of Tables and Symbols/Units

| Item | Value | Unit | Notes |
|---|---:|:---:|---|
| Throughput | 12,345 | RPS | Peak value is 18,900 RPS |
| Latency (P50) | 3.2 | ms | `--enable-cache` is enabled |
| Latency (P99) | 41.7 | ms | Includes periods of garbage collection (GC) |
| Memory | 1.5 | GB | Based on RSS; cgroup limit is 2GB |
| Disk I/O | 220 | MB/s | Via NVMe-oF (TCP)


## 2. Task List

- [x] Accuracy of Markdown header translations
- [x] Preservation of keywords within code blocks (`for`, `if`, `return`, etc.)
- [ ] Preservation of Mermaid diagrams and disregard of comments
- [ ] Preservation of units (GB/ms/%), paths (`/etc/hosts`)
- [ ] Preservation of inline formulas ($O(n \log n)$)


## 3. Code Blocks: Bash/Python/JSON/YAML

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

APP_ENV="${APP_ENV:-prod}"
INPUT="${1:-/data/input.txt}"
OUT="/var/tmp/result.json"

echo "[INFO] Starting job on $(hostname) at $(date -Iseconds)"

  echo "[ERROR] Input not found: $INPUT" >&2
  exit 1

curl -sS -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api" \  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \  -d "{"env":"$APP_ENV","count":$lines}" > "$OUT"

jq -r '.status' "$OUT" | grep -q success && echo "OK" || { echo "FAIL"; exit 2; }
```

## 6. Mixing formulas with text

- Average time complexity: $O(n \log n)$, worst case: $O(n^2)$
- Variance: $\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\mu)^2$
- Sample mean: $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum x_i$

Paragraph example: This paragraph is a sample to test whether the translation will properly preserve **bold**, *italic* text, and `code* when mixed together. It includes emojis üòÄ, Chinese characters (Êº¢Â≠ó), as well as English text written in CamelCase, snake_case, and kebab-case formats.

### 7.1 Experimental section ‚Äì Variation patterns
The following paragraphs are similar, but to prevent duplicate translations, the vocabulary and order are slightly altered with each iteration.
- Scenario: Summary of conversation records

- When the cache miss rate increases by 10%, throughput decreases by approximately 7%.
- When the connection pool size is increased from 32 to 64, the retry rate per second decreases from 1.2% to 0.6%.

## 9. Conclusion
This document serves as a sample for evaluating whether translation engines properly handle **format preservation**, **terminology consistency**, and the rules for ignoring code/formulas/pathnames. If necessary, more sections can be added using the same pattern to extend this document to over 100,000 characters.
