# Translation Test Document Using Rich Markdown

This document is a collection of Korean content in various formats, designed to **definitely exceed 4096 tokens**. Its purpose is to test the **robustness** of translation engines/LLMs, including their ability to handle context, preserve formats, and ignore code and charts.

> **Guidelines**
> 1) Ensure that code blocks and `mermaid` sections are preserved as-is.
> 2) Verify the preservation of numbers and units (e.g., 1.2GB, 3ms), slash-separated paths (`/var/log/app.log`), and options (`--flag`).
> 3) The layout should not be disrupted even if tables, lists, quotes, checkboxes, formulas, and emojis 😀 are mixed together.


## 1. Mixing Tables with Symbols/Units

| Item | Value | Unit | Comment |
|---|---:|:---:|---|
| Processing Rate | 12,345 | RPS | Up to 18,900 RPS at peak |
| Latency (P50) | 3.2 | ms | With `--enable-cache` enabled |
| Latency (P99) | 41.7 | ms | Includes periods of garbage collection |
| Memory | 1.5 | GB | Based on RSS, with cgroup limits set at 2GB |
| Disk I/O | 220 | MB/s | Via NVMe-oF (TCP)


## 2. Task List

- [x] Accuracy of Markdown header translations
- [x] Preservation of keywords within code blocks (`for`, `if`, `return`, etc.)
- [ ] Preservation of Mermaid diagrams and ignoring comments
- [ ] Preservation of units (GB/ms/%) and paths (`/etc/hosts`)
- [ ] Preservation of the inline formula `$O(n \log n)`


## 3. Code Blocks: Bash/Python/JSON/YAML

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

APP_ENV="${APP_ENV:-prod}"
INPUT="${1:-/data/input.txt}"
OUT="/var/tmp/result.json"

echo "[INFO] Starting job on $(hostname) at $(date -Iseconds)"
if [[ ! -f "$INPUT" ]]; then
  echo "[ERROR] Input not found: $INPUT" >&2
  exit 1
fi

lines=$(wc -l < "$INPUT")
echo "[DEBUG] Number of lines: $lines"

curl -sS -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api" \  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \  -d "{"env":"$APP_ENV","count":$lines}" > "$OUT"

jq -r '.status' "$OUT" | grep -q success && echo "OK" || { echo "FAIL"; exit 2; }
```

        if i >= k - 1:
            out.append(acc / k)
    return out

## 6. Mixing Formulas and Text

- Average Time Complexity: $O(n \log n)$, Worst Case: $O(n^2)$
- Variance: $\sigma^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\mu)^2$
- Sample Mean: $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum x_i$

Paragraph Example: This paragraph is a sample to verify that bold text, italic text, and code blocks are properly preserved during translation. It includes emojis 😀, Chinese characters (漢字), English CamelCase, snake_case, and kebab-case formats.



### 7.1 Experiment Section – Variation Patterns

# Internationalization (i18n) — Case #800

## Conclusion
This document serves as an example to evaluate whether translation engines properly handle **format preservation**, **term consistency**, and the **rule of ignoring code/formulas Paths**.  
If necessary, more sections can be added using the same pattern to extend the content beyond 100,000 characters.

# Extended Section 1

## Repeat Block 1-1
This paragraph has been included to create a very long document.

It contains a mix of various grammatical structures and Korean text.

This allows us to assess the translation quality, as well as issues related to token limitations and context loss.

```bash
echo 'section 1-1' >> /tmp/out.log
```

## Repeat Block 1-2
This paragraph has been included to create a very long document.

It contains a mix of various grammatical structures and Korean text.

This allows us to assess the translation quality, as well as issues related to token limitations and context loss.

```bash
echo 'section 1-2' >> /tmp/out.log
```
